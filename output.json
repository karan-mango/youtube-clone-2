        "description": "Curd or Dahi is one of the most cherished dairy products by us Indians.  But which curd do you use? Amul, Mother dairy, from a regional brand or from the local dairy?  Basically, which is the best curd in the Indian market? Letâ€™s find out. \n\nBuy Tru Hair Oil with Tru Heater - https://truhairandskin.com/product/tru-hair-oil-with-heater/?utm_source=FTE13&utm_medium=YT \n(Apply code FT05 to get 5% off)\n\nCurd not only amplifies the taste of any meal but also being rich in calcium, probiotics and protein, it is among the top strength giving foods on the planet. But is it true for the packaged curd that we generally buy? To find out the best curd in India, I have thoroughly researched about all the options available and have categorised them into 4 categories.\n\n00:57 - CATEGORY #1 - The most popular packaged curds. Be it Amul masti dahi, Mother dairy dahi or whatever local brand that is available near you. \n02:57 - CATEGORY #2 - Curd sourced from a local dairy.  I tried setting the curd using the same milk but two different active cultures, one from the local dairy and other from packaged curd. Results were shocking.\n04:24 - CATEGORY #3 - This one is much better than the ones discussed in the above two categories.\n05:30 - Dishonourable Mention -  The recent trend of greek fruit yoghurts.\n06:02 - CATEGORY #4 - This is by far the best curd you can eat for your health.\n\nFOODS & PRODUCTS RELATED TO THE VIDEO (Not Sponsored)ðŸ“¦\nTata Rock Salt (Rs 120/kg) - https://amzn.to/3pz0nEz\nRock Salt (Rs 54/500g) - https://amzn.to/3p9feW0\nOrganic Pink Rock Salt (Rs 100/kg) - https://amzn.to/3vfDolo\nRock Salt Grinder (Rs 100/100g) - https://amzn.to/3LXx3RG\nBlack salt Powder (Rs 80/kg) - https://amzn.to/3hf2EQo\nBlack salt powder (Rs 170/kg) - https://amzn.to/3peyK3f\nBlack salt grinder (Rs 89/100g) - https://amzn.to/3BUcMYr\nNatureland organics Lemon pickle (Rs165/350g) - https://amzn.to/3vev1qq\nNatureland organics Chilli pickle (Rs 165/350g) - https://amzn.to/3LXWSAN\nGlobal Village cafe Mango pickle (Rs 199/300g) - https://amzn.to/3JLhMBe\nTwo brothers lemon pickle (Rs 700/500g) - https://amzn.to/3M0Q05J\nNatureland organics Sugarcane vinegar (Rs 99/200ml) - https://amzn.to/3t6Z54i\nNatural Sugarcane vinegar (option 2, Rs 300/650ml) - https://amzn.to/3t4RAuP\nAmzul Coconut vinegar (Rs 420/750ml) - https://amzn.to/3JNsXtm\nCoconut vinegar (option 2, Rs 195/200ml) - https://amzn.to/3IgXGOV\n\n\nâœ…  If you want to support this work\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw/join\n\nINSTAGRAM :  Follow me on Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fittuber\n\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS ðŸ“¹\n20 Wheat Atta in India Ranked from Worst to Best\nhttps://youtu.be/e3nwRJM6Pjs\n7 Reasons You Are Eating Curd the Wrong Way\nhttps://youtu.be/65A_lShqZA8\n\nBEST PRODUCTS FROM UPDATED WORST TO BEST 2020 SERIES (Not Sponsored)\nShampoo (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2IdTmor\nShampoo (option 2)- https://amzn.to/2U7ZhwV\nShampoo (option 3) - https://amzn.to/3h1mDB6\nBathing Soap (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3rgaTzN\nBathing Soap (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3jMd2y0\nBathing Soap (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2JvBx6e\nToothpaste (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3jrcNbu\nToothpaste (option 2) - https://amzn.to/35C4GDZ\nFace wash (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2J6vLW6\nFace wash (option 2) - https://amzn.to/2J5JRH6\nFace wash (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2J5QKs7\nHair oil (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2YU6zqh\nHair oil (option 2) - https://amzn.to/33uYhZI\nHair oil (option 3) - https://amzn.to/33tj938\nMoisturiser (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3n4cdCL\nMoisturiser (option 2) - https://amzn.to/38r46fE\nMoisturiser (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2U7Y0Z4\nCooking oil (option 1) - https://amzn.to/2K85ha5\nCooking oil (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3mqWUnY\nCooking oil (option 3)  - https://amzn.to/35AVSQw\nGhee (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3eplzUS\nGhee (option 2) - https://amzn.to/38cDTzG\nGhee (option 3) - https://amzn.to/34pRT7R\nBiscuits (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3p5XxEm\nBiscuits (option 2) - https://amzn.to/3p8aFJ3\nBiscuits (option 3) - https://amzn.to/2LJugRf\nNamkeen (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3riSnXs\nNamkeen (option 2) - https://amzn.to/2KgNxsX\nNamkeen (option 3) - https://amzn.to/3rbfIKi\nDeodorant (option 1) - https://amzn.to/38gp279\nDeodorant (option 2)- https://amzn.to/3ml5mox\nDeodorant (option 3)- https://amzn.to/2Vo22Ns\nHair Conditioner (option 1) - https://amzn.to/3oQ0o3S\nHair Conditioner (option 2) - https://amzn.to/2QJeTKm\n\n08:55 - Segment Partner - Tru hair oil with Tru Heater\n\nDISCLAIMER: Whatever I have spoken in this video is my honest opinion.

        "description": "Which is the best wheat flour in the Indian market? One food that a majority of India eats on a daily basis is atta. But which one do you use? Aashirwaad? Fortune? Patanjali? MP Sharbati atta? Organic or multigrain? What about the local chakki atta?  What do the reports say when 10 leading brands of wheat flour were tested? To put it simply, which is the best atta in the Indian market?\n\nBuy Mamaearth Toxin Free Mineral Based Sunscreen - https://bit.ly/3XXlNtY\n(Apply code FITTUBER21 to get 21% off)\nBuy from Amazon - https://amzn.to/3JPNu3a\n\nFor this video, I not only bought and carefully went through the ingredients and nutritional information of the wheat flours made by the most popular brands but also to delve deeper into the subject, I got in touch with various food experts. I met local flour mill owners and also got the opportunity to talk to wheat-growing farmers. Some of the things that came before me were shocking. Although one thing is for sure that watching this video, you will have a clear idea as to which atta you should buy. On the basis of my research, I have categorized all the atta available in the Indian market into 5 categories.\n\n01:35 - Category 1 - The first thing that comes to our mind about the atta in this category is, \"Do they have maida mixed in it?\"\n04:42 - Category 2 - This one is intensively marketed as superior atta. But is it? Not really.\n05:24 - Category 3 - You will stop buying multigrain atta after watching this.\n07:16 - Category 4 - Is organic wheat flour any good? It is definitely priced high.\n08:06 - Category 5 - This one is not easily available offline but it is undoubtedly the best atta in the Indian market\n09:56 - My Take - How to practically buy healthy atta?
